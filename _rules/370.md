Players late to class by more than 15 minutes receive a base point penalty equal to the number of minutes they are late minus 15 to a maximum base penalty of 45 points. Players absent from class will receive a 50 point base penalty. Penalty can be waived if valid excuse is provided to the professor before hand.

Base penalties are multiplied by the number of members already in the class at the time of the late student's arrival.
In the event of absence the base penalty will be multiplied by the number of members in class at the time of Nomic adjournment of that day.
