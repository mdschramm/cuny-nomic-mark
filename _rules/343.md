A count is taken of the number of rules voted on in each of the previous meetings. For each meeting going forward,
if the number of rules voted on exceeds the previous maximum, the chair of this meeting gets 20 points. 

The Secretary will track and report the numbers of rules voted on each meeting and track and report the rewards for the chair.
