Make rule 112 mutable. Replace the text of rule 112 with “The state of affairs that constitutes winning shall
be specified in this rule (rule 381).”

The winner of this game of nomic shall be chosen as the last action in the game through random number generation,
where each player’s probability of winning is the number of points they have divided by the total sum of points across
all players (N). 

Each player will be assigned a range of numbers in order of descending point total. For example, if player A has 100, player
B has 90, and player C has 80, player A’s range is 1-100, B’s is 101-191, and C’s is 192-272.

Random numbers are generated in rounds, where in each round, 5 random numbers between 1 and N will be rolled using
(https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/random-number-generator.php) or similar. When a random number falls
into a players range, they gain a star. If there are no ties for most stars, player with the most stars at the end of the round wins nomic.

Ties are broken playing successive generation rounds between the tying players.
5 minutes of time before adjournment will be allocated for this game.
